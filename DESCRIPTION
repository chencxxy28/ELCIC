Description: The empirical likelihood-Based consistent information criterion (ELCIC) conducts robust model selection for semiparametric models. It is free of distribution specification and power to locate the true model given large sample size. This package provides several usage of ELCIC with applications in generalized linear model (GLM), generalized estimating equation (GEE) with complete/missing completely at random longitudinal data, and weighted GEE (WGEE) with drop out missingness. ELCIC can select not only mean model but also working correlation structure when the data is longitudinal.
